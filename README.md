# U.S. Air Force Contempt for the Constitution

The freedoms that Americans hold dear depends on the willingness of our Armed Forces to defend the Constitution. We cannot allow that honorable service, and our rights as citizens, to be corrupted by the leadership of the US Air Force who refuse to honor their oath to defend the Constitution. 

Thank you for reading the article Contempt for the Constitution by the US Air Force. This page contains links to the Full Account of the actions of the US Air Force, the Supporting Documentation and links for what action you can take.

The purpose of this website is to get the USAF to honor the Constitution. It is not to reopen my case. My case is minor and its over, there are no remaining legal options. It is provided as an example of what the USAF is willing to do. I keep hearing that the end of democracy is near. Real or not, I think the leadership culture of the Air Force should have a stronger commitment to the defense of the Constitution. If they are willing to ignore the Constitution in a small thing like this, we cannot depend on them to protect the Constitution when it comes to the big things.

# Constitutional Violations in the Denial of Tenure of Dr. Schultz

Dr. Schultz was fired from the Air Force Institute of Technology after having been denied tenure. “The Item of biggest concern” was a false accusation that Dr. Schultz had lied on his application. That allegation was origionally made by an external reviewer. Dr. Schultz was not informed of the complaint nor given any chance to respond to the allegations before critical decisions denying him tenure were made. The review committee did an improper review by claiming there was no evidence of bias, by finding the external reviewer qualified despite being in a different academic field and clearly not meeting the written standards, and by refusing to make any attempt to have a review of Dr. Schultz’s career contribution by qualified and unbiased reviewers as require by regulation. The actions of AFIT in denying tenure based on accusations without allowing Dr. Schultz to respond, by conducting an improper review, and by not using the published standards, clearly violated Dr. Schultz’s Constitutional rights to due process. A full explanation and supporting documents are provided in the following files.
